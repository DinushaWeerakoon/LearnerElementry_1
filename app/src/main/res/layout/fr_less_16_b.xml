Many people spend much of their free-time slouched in front of TV sets. As a result, they do not get enough physical exercise which is necessary for a healthy life. Further, watching television for long hours hinders the development of mind. It is well-known fact that the brain slows down when a person is watching television. Another disadvantage is that television often causes people to become dissatisfied with their lives. The reason for this, is that to many people, what they see in television: for instance, a tele - drama or an advertisement, become very real. People try to live something shown in the television and become depressed when they fail. Another danger in watching television is that some people cannot stop watching it and become addict to it. As a result they do not spend enough time on important areas of their lives, such as education, sports, reading, vising and entertaining with friends and family."/>
